# Peatland-3.1
Peatland is a soil carbon cycle model specifically developed for modelling peat carbon loss by peat drainage. It includes also CH4 emission to calculate trade-off betweeen rewetting of peat soils and continued drainage

This version is still under development and review, and has not been tested extensively yet.
The model includes a simple soil hydrologic model and soil freezing and permafrost. First publication:
VAN HUISSTEDEN, J.; VAN DEN BOS, Remco; ALVAREZ, I. Marticorena. Modelling the effect of water-table management on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from peat soils. Netherlands Journal of Geosciences, 2006, 85.1: 3-18.
Version 3.1 is being developed to include a number of improvements:
- Complete carbon balance output
- Anaerobic non-CH4 organic matter decomposition
- Temperature sensitivity improvement for all soil carbon reservoirs
- Carbon immobilization by binding to mineral particles

WARNING: THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET!!!!
